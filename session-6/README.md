# Session 6; Day 14
This was how far we journeyed together in exactly two weeks 
of learning `JavaScript` with `React.js` in view, and conforming 
as much as possible, to the **ES6** standard.

In this session, we learned about the following:
- Function default parameters
- Template literals
- Destructuring

We were interrupted when the PC of the presenter ran out of power

By this time, we had as well built from very simple to a bit
complex things with `JavaScript` (individually), especially manipulating `HTML`
and `CSS` documents.

The video for this session will be available on [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU10dryLOLEGEnWCZgG87VkvAi-fPaDfE) soon
