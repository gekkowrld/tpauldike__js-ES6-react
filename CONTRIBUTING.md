Every interested fellow is invited to make contributions to this repository but the following terms and conditions are to be strictly adhered to,
to ensure orderliness and peaceful collaboration.

## Terms and Condition

### 1. Fork the Repo and Create Your Own Branch

To contribute to any work in this repository, you have to:

3. Add your work; avoid bugs.
4. Test the codes and be sure that they are working as expected
5. Create a pull request for your work to be reviewed and merged into the **main** branch

### 2. Only Work in the [projects](./projects) Directory

Note that the contents of this repository *(especially in the directories named **sessions**)* were written in live sessions and saved so that the one who follows the live recordings can see the codes on GitHub, the way they were written in the [recorded videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU10dryLOLEGEnWCZgG87VkvAi-fPaDfE).
You don't want to alter the codes; if you wish to work on any of them, make a copy of it in the [projects](./projects) directory and make all the alterations or modifications or improvements there.

### 3. Name the File properly

- If you're doing a new project, name the file using a number in base 15 as the prefix, and then a hyphen `-` and the name of the project.
In other words, the projects are numbered from 0, follow the order.
- Name your functions and variables properly, conforming to the necessary conventions.

```txt
 Note that base 15 comprises **0 - f**. e.g; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f, 10, 11, 12, ... 1f and so on.
```

### 4. Make Enough Documentation

Firstly, add your project (if it's a new one) to the list of the projects on the [README](./projects/README.md) at the root of the [projects](./projects) directory.

Next, let us see the necessary documents that will make us to understand your work and probably your logic, especially a `README.md` file ***in the directory where you did your work***

If you refactored or improved on someone else's project, you may want to add your contribution to the README of that particular project

### 5. Use Good Commit Messages

You don't want to create the wrong impressions with your commit messages, let them reflect your activities on GitHub.
